# ☁️ Cloud File Manager + Auto Backup System

A secure, cloud-based file manager that lets users **upload**, **manage**, **backup**, and **restore** their files — with automatic versioning, scheduling, and secure access, all built using **AWS Free Tier services**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Drag-and-drop file upload  
✅ Auto daily backups using EventBridge + Lambda  
✅ File restore from any backup or version  
✅ User authentication via AWS Cognito  
✅ File versioning with AWS S3  
✅ Backup success/failure email alerts (SNS)  
✅ Admin dashboard to view usage  
✅ Built with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, AWS, and Serverless stack

## 💻 Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- ⚛️ React + Vite
- 🎨 TailwindCSS
- 🔁 React Router v7
- 🔐 AWS Cognito (Auth)

### Backend (Serverless):
- 🧠 AWS Lambda (upload, backup, restore)
- 🌐 API Gateway
- ☁️ Amazon S3 (file storage, versioning)
- 📊 DynamoDB (file metadata)
- 📅 EventBridge (scheduled backups)
- 📩 Amazon SNS (email notifications)
- 🔒 IAM (secure permissions)
- 🕵️ CloudWatch (monitoring/logs)

## 🧠 Core Concepts You'll Understand

| Cloud Concept | How It’s Used |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Object Storage** | Store & retrieve files using Amazon S3 |
| **Serverless Computing** | Run logic via AWS Lambda without managing servers |
| **Event-Driven Backup** | Auto backups via EventBridge triggering Lambda |
| **User Authentication** | AWS Cognito User Pool for login/signup |
| **Access Control** | IAM roles restrict each function’s access |
| **Monitoring & Alerts** | CloudWatch for logs, SNS for notifications |
| **Versioning** | S3 versioning to manage restore logic |
| **Database (NoSQL)** | DynamoDB tracks user files & metadata |

## 🧪 How to Use

### 🚦 Prerequisites
- ✅ AWS Free Tier account
- ✅ Node.js & Python installed
- ✅ AWS CLI + IAM User configured (`aws configure`)
- ✅ S3 buckets created (main + backup)

---

### 🛠️ Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/cloud-file-backup.git
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
````

```bash
# Deploy Lambda (e.g. upload)
cd backend/lambda
zip upload.zip upload.py
aws lambda create-function --function-name UploadFile ...
```

---

## 📦 Deployment Plan (AWS Free Tier)

| Service     | Free Tier Included           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| S3          | 5 GB + 20K GET + 2K PUT      |
| Lambda      | 1M requests + 400K GB-sec    |
| DynamoDB    | 25 GB storage + 200M req     |
| API Gateway | 1M API calls                 |
| Cognito     | 50,000 monthly active users  |
| EventBridge | 100,000 rules/month          |
| SNS         | 1,000 email deliveries/month |
| CloudWatch  | 5 GB logs                    |

⚠️ **Cost after limits** is minimal unless you serve large files or high volume. Use S3 lifecycle policies to auto-delete.
